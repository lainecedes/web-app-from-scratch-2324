# Web App From Scratch 23/24
In this course, I'm going to build a web application and learn how it works by importing the fewest possible libraries, frameworks or
other resources (vanilla) and using the browser platform as much as possible through HTML, CSS & JavaScript.    
The end result is a modular, single page web app (SPA).
The aim is to build a web app that retrieves data from an external API and to manipulate it to display in the UI of the app, while making it as responsive and accessible as possible. 

## What is this web app about?
This is an web app where I will be showcasing my personalized profile in a theme of my favorite games, with Stardew Valley being the most prominent. 
I made this app to showcase loading personal data both out of a JSON file and both out of an external API.

It has:
1. Avatar
2. Personal information such as name, age, bio and Github username retrieved from a JSON data format
3. Item interface with icons of my favorite games:
    - Mario Kart
    - Stardew Valley
    - A clickable Animal Crossing icon which shows a NookPhone where my favorite species of villagers are shown

This app is for mobile screens (made on size iPhone XR), and is mostly responsive.
